# Collaborative editor using Quill and Yjs
This was built as an experimental project, to test the waters for building collaborative systems. Here we've used off-the-shelf tools like quilljs and Yjs to build a collaborative editor.

## How to run?
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies using `npm i`
3. Run the server using `npm start`
4. In another shell, run the front-end using `npm run fe:serve`
4. Open your favorite browser and go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

To test out collaboration, open the page in a different tab or browser, or you could just access it via other devices on your LAN.
